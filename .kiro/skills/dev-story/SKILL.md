# Develop Story Workflow

Implement story with tests:

1. Load `_bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml` - this is the CORE OS
2. Read its contents and understand the workflow execution framework
3. Execute `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/dev-story/workflow.yaml`
4. Follow workflow.xml instructions EXACTLY
5. Save implementation outputs after each section
